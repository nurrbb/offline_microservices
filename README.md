# Offline Microservices 
[Microservisler ile Modern Yazılım Geliştirme: Teoriden Pratiğe](https://www.techcareer.net/courses/temelden-ileri-seviyeye-microservice-egitimi)

This repository hosts a collection of microservices designed for offline scenarios, where services operate independently without requiring continuous internet connectivity. The architecture ensures reliability, scalability, and modularity for applications that need to function seamlessly in offline environments.

## Project Overview

The Offline Microservices project aims to provide:

- **Decoupled services:** Each microservice is self-contained, reducing dependencies.
- **Data persistence:** Supports local data storage for offline operations.
- **Synchronization:** Ensures data consistency once connectivity is restored.
- **Scalability:** Modular design facilitates easy addition of new services.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot:** `Core framework for microservices.`
- **H2/SQLite:** `Offline database for local storage.`
- **Docker:** `Containerization for deployment.`
- **Maven:** `Build tool for dependency management.`
